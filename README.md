# Finding Hooman
This is a third-year project for Games and Animation students to develop a prototype game in two weeks with the theme of "smell". The current idea is a 3D adventure game where the player is a dog who can sniff objects in order to solve puzzles and find their Hooman.

### Demos

Here are a couple gifs demonstrating the prototype development before assets such as shaders, models and artwork were added:

After the prototype development, the team are now working to port the game into Unreal Engine. The image below shows the latest state of the game in UE:
