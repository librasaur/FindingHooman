# Finding Hooman
This is a third-year project for Games and Animation students to develop a prototype game using Unity in two weeks with the theme of "smell". As a team we came up with the concept of a 3D adventure game where the player is a dog who can sniff objects in order to solve puzzles and find their Hooman.

After the prototype development, the team are now working to [port the game into Unreal Engine](https://github.com/lizziebriggs/FindingHooman-Unreal) and develop more features and assets.

### Demos

Here are a couple showcases demonstrating the prototype development:
